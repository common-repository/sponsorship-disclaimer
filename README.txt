Using shortcode [sponsor] to apply a default sponsored article disclaimer where needed in a blog post.

== Description ==

This plugin creates the shortcode [sponsor] to implement a default disclaimer line wherever and whenever its required. The Sponsorship Disclaimer plugin also creates a button in both the Visual and Text editors to quickly create the shortcode without having to remember any code for it.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the '/wp-content/plugins/spon-disclaim-shortcode' directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the disclaimer note editable? =

If using the shortcode directly, (ie [sponsor]ABCompany[/sponsor]) no the text is not editable, unless you go right into the plugin's files and make changes that you see fit.

If you use the Visual Editor [$!] Sponsor Disclaimer button, you can edit the text if needed before publishing your post.


== Screenshots ==

1. The shortcode works by simply adding [sponsor]ABCompany Name[/sponsor] wherever your disclaimer is required. Alternatively, you can simply highlight the company name, and press the [$!] Sponsor Disclaimer button instead.
2. This is a preview of the disclaimer text, regardless of whether you use the shortcode directly, or the Visual/Text editor buttons. The disclaimer is editable if needed, only by use of the Visual Editor button.
